**Project Overview:**
Project Copper is a collaborative initiative aimed at creating a sub-network between server and computers. The project involves scripting an access menu that facilitates server-to-client communication, enabling remote actions on the client's machine.
The script produced should work on any linux framework although we used VMbox and virtual machines for the creation process. Additionnaly the script will create logs of it's activity on the remote machine.


**Network Setup:**
The network utilizes an SSH connection between machines, allowing for the execution of scripts from the server's terminal on a remote computer.


**Available Commands:**
- Add/remove users on the client side
- Reboot the client machine
- Shut down the client machine remotely
